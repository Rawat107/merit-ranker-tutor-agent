      "text": "Ans.(a) Sol. The sentence states that black pepper is an essential component of cuisines worldwide and has been used for centuries. Since the present relevance of black pepper is emphasized, the verb must be in the present simple tense to indicate a general fact. • \"Remains\" means continues to be or still is, which suits the sentence best. • Other options like \"signifies,\" \"denotes,\" \"embodies,\" and \"constitutes\" focus on meaning or representation rather than continued existence. Meanings of all options: • Remains – continues to be in the same state without changing or disappearing. • Signifies – serves as a symbol, indication, or representation of something. • Denotes – explicitly states or refers to the exact meaning of something. • Embodies – represents or expresses an idea, quality, or concept in a tangible or recognizable form. • Constitutes – makes up or forms a part of something larger or important. S34. Ans.(e) Sol. The sentence discusses how black pepper was originally cultivated in South Asia. Since this refers to a past action, we need past simple tense. • \"Was\" correctly reflects that black pepper was cultivated in the past. • \"Had been\" and \"was being\" suggest past perfect and past continuous, which are incorrect here as there is no indication of another past action happening before or simultaneously.",

Meanings of all options: • Is – present tense of “to be,” meaning something currently exists. • Has – present perfect, used when something started in the past and continues to the present. • Had been – past perfect, used when an action was completed before another past action. • Was being – past continuous, implying an action was ongoing at a past time. • Was – simple past, used for an event that happened and was completed in the past. S35. Ans.(c) Sol. The sentence describes where black pepper's aroma comes from. Since \"comes\" is in present simple, the verb in this blank must also be in present simple tense to indicate a general truth. • Originates – begins or starts from a specific place or situation. • Other options like \"emerges, stems, and exudes\" are more about growth, flow, or spreading, which do not directly fit the meaning of an aroma coming from oils.",
