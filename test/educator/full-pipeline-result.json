        "Entanglement",
        "Quantum Parallelism",
        "Quantum Tunneling"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "Quantum Parallelism",
      "explanation": "Quantum computers can exploit the principle of superposition, where a quantum bit (qubit) can exist in multiple states simultaneously, allowing them to perform parallel computations on a massive scale.",

      "question": "Which of the following is a key difference between classical and quantum computing?",
      "options": [
        "Classical computers use transistors, while quantum computers use qubits",
        "Classical computers use deterministic logic, while quantum computers use probabilistic logic",
        "Classical computers can only process one set of data at a time, while quantum computers can process multiple sets simultaneously",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "All of the above",
      "explanation": "All of the listed options highlight key differences between classical and quantum computing, including the use of qubits instead of transistors, probabilistic logic instead of deterministic logic, and the ability to process multiple sets of data simultaneously.",

        "Superposition",
        "Entanglement",
        "Quantum Tunneling",
        "Decoherence"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "Entanglement",
      "explanation": "Quantum entanglement is a phenomenon where the state of one quantum particle is directly influenced by the state of another, even when they are separated by a large distance. This phenomenon is a key feature of quantum mechanics and is exploited in quantum computing and communication.",

      "question": "What happens when a quantum system is measured or observed?",
      "options": [
        "The system remains in a superposition of states",
        "The system collapses into a single, definite state",
        "The system becomes entangled with the measurement device",
        "The system undergoes quantum tunneling"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "The system collapses into a single, definite state",
      "explanation": "According to the principles of quantum mechanics, when a quantum system is measured or observed, it collapses from a superposition of states into a single, definite state. This process is known as quantum measurement or the measurement problem.",
